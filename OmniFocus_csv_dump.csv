Make a ticket that says “Final Project”

Requirements
	•	In the previous development logs, you've laid out your requirements, screen designs, and data flow for your final project. Now, it's time to make your pitch!
	•	In your JIRA console, make a new Feature Item called ""Final Project"", and add all of the previously defined tasks that you think you can do over the last half of the semester (7 weeks). Remember this should include requirement, UI, and data flow tasks.
	•	Send an email to hococoder@gmail.com when you've completed adding tasks, and I'll provide some feedback as to whether that will work as a final project.
	•	Once you have received the OK from me, you may start working on your final project - they are due at the end of Week 13, and during week 14, you will present them to the class group.

All - I've looked at Dev Log 2 entries, and made comments - you should get notifications about them.  A few of you didn't specify how you were going to persist your data, which was a big call out for this assignment - so please make sure you nail that down before Dev Log 3 is turned in.


Speaking of Dev Log 3 - if you want to start putting your list of tickets together before Sunday <http://airmail.calendar/2018-03-08%2012:00:00%20EST> and iterate with me then, feel free - otherwise we will iterate afterwards."
